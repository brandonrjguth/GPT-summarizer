# GPT-summarizer
A chrome extension for summarizing and asking questions about text on the page.

Currently setup for use for myself. However you can use it yourself by doing the following:

1) Edit index.js and replace "Your api key here" with your openAI api key.
2) Run the server from the /server directory with "npm start"
3) Load the entire folder as an unpacked extension in chrome
